            <h1>Ryan Field</h1>

            <p>
                Welcome to my site! I'm an intermediate backend developer who loves working with Java and Spring Boot. I've always had a
                personal interest in exploring frontend technologies to help myself become a more well-rounded developer. Every time I
                have tried frontend related things in the past, I would always get stuck on the design and layout aspects. After
                recently completing a CSS course, this website is my first real project using the new skills I have.

                    <br>
                    <br> Each day is an exciting challenge as I'm constantly implementing new features that will be used
                    by
                    thousands of people. This involves creating APIs for multiple microservices, coordinating with our
                    frontend team and also working with
                    our cloud infrastructure.
                    <br>
                    <br> I love the challenge of planning out the best solution to implement the next big feature. I
                    also
                    find my role very rewarding, as I love being able to release something I worked on and be able to go
                    to
                    the marketplace myself to show

                    FIS was my first development job after graduating from university. I was tasked with maintaining and updating various
                    financial applications for a range of banks.
                    <br>
                    <br> I was part of a very small team working on multiple Spring Boot applications that also used the
                    inbuilt Spring template engine, no seperation of frontend and backend! This project and team structure
                    resulted in everyone essentially have
                    equal responsibility for all aspects. Because of this I was able to get a lot of exposure and
                    experience
                    to a lot of other aspects of development rather than just backend coding; such as devops and
                    deployment.
                    I even had to interact with
                    and IBM mainframe from time to time.
                    <br>
                    <br> Throughout my time at FIS, aside from day to day bug fixing, there were two main projects I was a part of. I spent a lot
                    of time upgrading some of our applications from the Struts framework over to Spring. Once that was complete, I was then
                    appointed to lead our efforts in resolving the hundreds of the vulnerabilities found throughout our applications.

                Initially, this website was created as an exercise in testing out some new skills I learned. I may have learned the
                basics of CSS layout, but my methodologies and CSS structure is pretty bad. My next steps will be to first refactor my
                existing CSS to be more logical and readable. Once I've done that and learned some best practices, then I will move onto
                converting all my styles into Sass. I think that starting with vanillas CSS will allow me to get a better grip on the
                basics before I do more advanced things.
            </p>
            <p class="about__text">
                After getting a Sass library for the site, I hope to expand it a bit. I plan to create some more pages to showcase some
                of my work and act more like a portfolio. This will probably start as some small JavaScript projects so that I can learn
                about adding that final piece of the puzzle to this pure HTML and CSS site.
