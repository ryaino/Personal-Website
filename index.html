            <p>
                Welcome to my site! I'm an intermediate backend developer who loves working with Java and Spring Boot.
                I've always had a personal interest in exploring frontend technologies to help myself become a more well
                rounded developer. Every time I have tried
                frontend related things in the past I would always get stuck on the design aspect and end up
                giving up. After recently completing a CSS course, this website is my first real project using the new
                skills I have.

                My days are currently spent workin on the <a href="https://channelfireball.com">Channel Fireball
                    Marketplace</a> which is a growing e-commerce platform.
                <br>
                <br> Each day is an exciting challenge as I'm constantly implementing new features that will be used by
                thousands of people. This involves creating APIs for multiple microservices, coordinating with our
                frontend team and also working with
                our cloud infrastructure.
                <br>
                <br> I love the challenge of planning out the best solution to implement the next big feature. I also
                find my role very rewarding as I love being able to release something I worked on and be able to go to
                the marketplace myself to show
                friends and family what I've done.

                FIS was my first development job after graduating university. I was tasked with maintaining and updating
                various financial applications for a range of banks.
                <br>
                <br> I was part of a very small team working on multiple Spring Boot applications that also used the
                inbuilt spring templating, no seperation of frontend and backend! This project and team structure
                resulted in everyone essentially have
                equal responsibility for all aspects. Because of this I was able to get a lot of exposure and experience
                to a lot of other aspects of development rather than just backend coding; such as devops and deployment.
                I even had to interact with
                and IBM mainframe from time to time.
                <br>
                <br> Throughout my time at FIS, aside from day to day bugfixing, there were two main projects I was a
                part of. I spent a lot of time upgrading some of our applications from the Struts framework over to
                Spring. Once that was complete I
                was then appointed to lead our efforts in resolving the hundreds of the vulnerabilities found throughout
                our applications.

                Initially this website was created as an excercise in testing out some new skills I learned. I may
                have learned the basics of CSS layout but my methodologies and CSS structure is pretty bad. My next
                steps will be to first refactor my existing css to be more logical and readable. Once I've done that
                and learned some more best practices then I will move onto converting all my styles into Sass. I
                think that starting with vanillas CSS will allow me to get a better grip on the basics before I do
                more advanced things.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
                Atfer getting a Sass library for the site I hope to expand it a bit. I plan to create some more
                pages to showcase some of my work and act more like a portfolio. This will probably start as some
                small javascript projects so that I can learn about adding that final piece of the puzzle to this
                pure HTML and CSS site.
